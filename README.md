# remove_heights
Experimental TinyMCE plugin 

Listen to content changes (or before submitting)

Find all <td> and <tr> elements

Remove any height: from their style attribute

Leave other styles (like width:) intact

This way, the user never even sees height: in the editor, and the saved HTML is clean.
